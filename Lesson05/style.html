  <h1>What is Computing Kids?</h1>
  <p class="center large">Computing Kids is an educational enrichment program for children in grades K-8 in the Seattle and Eastside area. We partner with schools, community groups, and parents to bring computer programming classes to kids in a variety of settings.
  </p>
  <p id="p1">Hello World! </p>
  <p class="center border"> Every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science.</p>

  <h1>Why Is Computer Science Important for Younger  Students?</h1>
  <p style="color:olive; font-size:x-large; ">
    Computing continues to be one of the fastest growing fields, yet computer science is rarely part of childrenâ€™s core education. We believe that giving students opportunities to explore programming and learn coding skills is critical to supporting their
    academic success and beyond.
