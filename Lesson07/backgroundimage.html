Why Is Computer Science Important for Younger  Students?
</h1>
  <p style="color:olive; background-color:pink;font-size:x-large;">
    Computing continues to be one of the fastest growing fields, yet computer science is rarely part of childrenâ€™s core education. We believe that giving students opportunities to explore programming and learn coding skills is critical to supporting their
    academic success and beyond.
